# Crazyflie PC client for esp-drone

The esp-drone PC client is a fork of the [Crazyflie PC client](./ORIGIN_README.md). The communication with esp-drone and the implementation of the CRTP protocol to control the esp-drone is handled by the modified [cflib](https://github.com/leeebo/crazyflie-lib-python)

## cflib

The client requires the folked [cflib](https://github.com/leeebo/crazyflie-lib-python).
If you want to develop with the lib too, follow the cflib readme to install it.

## Installation
See the [installation instructions](docs/installation/install.md) in the GitHub docs folder.
